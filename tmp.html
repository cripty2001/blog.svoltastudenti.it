Basics of scrollbound effects
Overview
The amp-position-observer component monitors the position of an element within the viewport as a user scrolls, and dispatches enter, exit and scroll:<Position In Viewport As a Percentage> events (Low Trust Level), which can be used to trigger actions (Only Low Trust Actions) on other components (e.g., amp-animation.

The amp-position-observer component is only useful when used with other components and does not do anything on its own.

What can I do with amp-position-observer?
Currently, amp-animation and several video players in AMP are the only components that allow low-trust events to trigger their actions (e.g., starting an animation, seeking to a position within the animation, pausing a video, etc.).

Scroll-bound animations
The amp-animation component exposes a seekTo action that can be tied to the scroll event of amp-position-observer to implement scroll-bound animations.

Example: Animation rotates as user scrolls
Imagine an animation where the hour hand of a clock rotates as the user scrolls the page.

Scrollbound animation demo

<!-- An animation that rotates a clock hand 180 degrees. -->
<!--
   Note that we are NOT setting `trigger=visibility`
   since we will manually trigger the animation.
-->
<amp-animation id="clockAnim" layout="nodisplay">
  <script type="application/json">
      {
      "duration": "3s",
      "fill": "both",
      "direction": "alternate",
      "animations": [
        {
          "selector": "#clock-scene .clock-hand",
          "keyframes": [
            { "transform": "rotate(-180deg)" },
            { "transform": "rotate(0deg)" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  </script>
</amp-animation>

<!-- The clock container -->
<div id="clock-scene">
  <!--
    Use amp-position-observer to tie the movement of the clock scene within
    the viewport to the timeline of the animation
